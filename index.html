<h1>About this site</h1>
    <br>
<p>Being an international student from China, one thing for sure is that I definitively miss the food from my hometown all the time when I am here in Australia. So I decided to create my website on introducing the authentic food / cuisine from my home, which is Northeastern Chinese cuisine. However, this doesn’t mean I will give the audience a grand introduction of traditional Chinese food. Since there are tons of different kind of Chinese cuisines and you can probably find plenty of relevant resources online about, I will be focusing on my own hometown food and food of my hometown only. I am more than happy to present to the audience the essence of it from a native point of view. I consider myself a foodie and I am fairly passionate about this. Also, because China is so big, different kinds of food from each area is quite unique and diverse and all of each can be extended into a lot of content. Thus I do have sufficient content to introduce when it comes to this topic. After much consideration, I chose to include content of the following areas in the website. First is the introductions of this unique kind of Chinese cuisine, presenting one or two iconic dishes for each kind as example. Second I have also decided to add some recipes of some typical dishes, especially those I often cook. What’s more, I think providing some articles and relevant resources about it is also a good idea for allowing interested audience to explore more.
My major target audience will be western people who have great interests in Chinese food as well as the culture. To sum up, I hope I can use this site to present them true authentic traditional Chinese food of my home instead what they often see in a Chinese restaurant here. Of course, I will try to be objective as much as possible when it comes to comparisons of any sort. What I also expect audience to take away from this website is some useful tips in traditional Chinese cooking. As I will be posting recipes and cooking instructions of some iconic dishes of my hometown as well. The goal is to introduce my hometown food and culture to the world and hopefully to intrigue them to explore more about China.
