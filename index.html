<h1>About this site</h1>
    <br>
<p>ChineseNortheasternCuisine is a non-commercial website offering information, explanations as well as instructions to people who have great interests in Chinese food and culture. Unlike most of the website online about Chinese cuisine. Mine would be solely focused on a specific branch of Chinese cuisine, which belongs to my hometown, the northeastern part of China. Since there are already plenty of different kinds of foods that cover the vast land of the mainland China, some of them have already become fairly world-wide famous and there are plenty of relevant resources online about them. So this is where I believe ChineseNortheasternCuisine will stand out: With in-depth introductions and illustrations, the website will offer audience a unique experience in presenting the spotlight and features of Dong Bei Cai, my hometown’s food. <br>The site would also include simple cooking instructions of some iconic dishes and provide relevant material(articles, photos, videos). Because what I also expect audience to take away from this website is some useful tips in traditional Chinese cooking. In this way, this website could be more useful and helpful. To sum up, the goal is to introduce my hometown’s food and culture to the world and hopefully to intrigue them to explore more about Dongbei, the northeastern part of China.
